# QtTrafficLight

This sample implements the logic of a traffic light and a pedestrian light. A user-interface for the application has been implemented in Qt and can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/qt-traffic-light).

The user interface shows the states of the traffic and pedestrian lights and also provides a push button which can be pushed to request a safe crossing of the street.

Note that this sample is not set-up to be built from within Code RealTime. Instead, just set the TC as active so C++ code gets generated, and then follow [the instructions](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/qt-traffic-light) to build and run the application from Qt Creator.
